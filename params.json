I'm Obelix, a creator of web content and a citizen of the internet.\r\n\r\n### What is this?\r\nThis is a site for my projects. I don't know what they will be yet, but it is sure to be cool.\r\n\r\n### Who are you again?\r\n\r\nI'm Obelix. I am a creator, writer, reader, podcast-enthusiast, audiophile, programmer and amateur mathematician. I spend most of my time online, connected, and hope to provide you with some good content, whether that be videos on [YouTube](www.youtube.com), infographics on [/r/dataisbeautiful](www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful), webgames on [itch.io](www.itch.io) or programs on [Github](www.github.com).\r\n\r\n### Where can I find you?\r\n * The best place to reach me is on Twitter [@ObelixAndCo](https://twitter.com/ObelixAndCo/). \r\n * I'm setting up a YouTube channel, which you'll see soon here. I'm waiting until YouTube completely drops Google+ integration before confirming my custom url.\r\n * You can also PM me on reddit. I'm [/u/ObelixAndCo](http://www.reddit.com/user/obelixandco).\r\n * I'm also (obviously) on GitHub!\r\n\r\n## Thanks for visiting my website, and stick around for more!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
